### Hi there 👋

I'm Nico! I'm a passionate software & machine learning engineer with a strong focus on standards, best practices and architecture. 😎
I love working on challenging projects, which allow me to combine both of my chosen fields to create scalable and intelligent software solutions. 🤖

Also a Linux nerd. 🤓
